### About Me üß∏

I enjoy teaming up to use technology to solve challenges like **climate change**. Over the past two years at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/), I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience in data science, web development, and renewable energy projects. 

As an undergrad at Pace University, I teach students skills in code and analytics for the **Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences**; *view lessons [here]().*

### üìç Location
Currently based in vibrant New York City, near the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. 
I grew up in California's sunny Bay Area, and most summers, I head back to visit my family, friends, and two adorable dogs. 

Always up for exploring new spots or catching up ‚Äî **let me know** if you‚Äôre in the area!
