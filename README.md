## About Me 🧸

I enjoy teaming up to use technology to solve challenges like climate change. Over the past two years at SLAC, I’ve gained hands-on experience in data science, web development, and renewable energy projects within the Bay Area.

## 📍 Location

I’m based in Manhattan, New York, near the Brooklyn Bridge, but I grew up in San Jose, California. Most summers, you’ll find me there visiting my two dogs, Fudge and Moon 🐾. Let me know if you’re ever nearby—I’d love to catch up!
