## About Me üß∏

I enjoy teaming up to use technology to solve challenges like climate change. Over the past two years at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/), I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience in data science, web development, and renewable energy projects. 

As an undergrad at Pace University, I teach students skills in code and analytics for the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences; view lessons [here]().
